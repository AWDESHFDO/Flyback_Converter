The project focused on the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a Flyback converter to analyze its performance and validate the theoretical design. The converter was first simulated using MATLAB/Simulink to study its transformer-based energy transfer, switching characteristics, and voltage regulation behavior. The simulation phase provided insights into duty cycle control, magnetizing current, and output ripple, helping to refine component values before hardware implementation.

Following simulation, a hardware prototype of the Flyback converter was developed and tested under various input and load conditions. The MOSFET switching pulses were generated using a Wavect controller, connected to a custom-designed driver board developed in Altium Designer and fabricated on a PCB. A Chroma programmable DC power supply supplied the variable input voltage, while an electronic load was used to emulate different load scenarios.

Waveforms of input and output voltages, currents, and switching signals were monitored using an oscilloscope and a power analyzer to evaluate converter performance. During testing, slight irregularities in the pulse patterns were detected and corrected through Wavect controller parameter adjustments. The system was then operated in open loop mode to achieve stable voltage regulation and improved dynamic response.

In the output analysis, key performance metrics were measured, including Energy Loss Values, Individual Harmonic Amplitudes and Percentages, Voltage THD, and Current THD using analytical tools and software. These results, along with efficiency and waveform observations, were compared with MATLAB simulation data. The hardware and simulation outcomes showed strong correlation, confirming the Flyback converterâ€™s efficiency, reduced harmonic distortion, and overall design accuracy.
